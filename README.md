This project depicts global population information categorized by gender on Microsoft Excel.
It includes,
Cleaned dataset of population by gender
Pivot table to categorize male and female population
Interactive bar chart displaying male vs female population
Gender-based filtering to analyze data for each country or age group
Customized color scheme for easy gender differentiation
The main objective to visualize and compare population distribution across male and female segments, with dynamic filtering to compare population statistics based on various segments like country or age group.
Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (Bar Chart + Pivot Table)
Excel Slicers for filter
Data labels and formatting for clarity
Insight:
The population of males is slightly higher than that of females in the world. The disparity (~43 million) looks big on paper but is very small relative to the whole (4+ billion for both sexes).
